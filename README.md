# ProxyChecker

Ages ago I was desperate for something like this - I wanted something that could check fast on websites to my liking and where I could see the source.

Today I thought I'm probably at a level to make something like this so did just that - I made the program but wanted to get speed.
A friend of mine who doesn't use github helped me with the concept - I forgot to use global variables and had problems with multithreading values - if your reading this - thank you so much!!
